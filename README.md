# KGLinkPrediction

We attempt to conduct several link prediction experiments with some well known
geospatial knowledge graphs and techniques. The aim is to test whether
existing solutions apply to an arbitrary geospatial context such as South Tyrol or Bavaria
and data such as CityGML.

## Experiment 1 (WIP)
UrbanKG (WIP)

## Experiment 2 (WIP)
Space2Vec (WIP)

We use the Space2Vec encoding algorithm to generate embeddings for the
geosptial link prediction tasks. 

## Data (WIP)
South Tyrol
- OSM data
- Construction data (CityGML v2 Level of Detail 0)
